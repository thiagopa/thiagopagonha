Not Ready

Still a work in progress, more like a study case.

Not recommended for production use.

My Ideia is to create a USEFUL Personal Site, with Blog, Wiki and cool stuff, what else ?

Project Requires:

autoload
dbindexer
django (non-rel)
djangoappengine
djangotoolbox
WebOs==1.1.1
SUDS (my github version)

Added PSN Account Integration wich is pretty cool ;P

install these on a virtualenv or put their symlinks on the root directory of your project ;P
